With this project I aim to analyze the cusotmer churn patterns within a telecom company to understand the underlying factors contributing to customer attrition. The study leverages historical customer data including demographic information, service usage metrics and cusotmer interaction logs. Through exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling techniques, key drivers of churn will be identified. such as service dissatisfaction, pricing strategies, contract terms and customer support effectiveness. </p>"
