    "\n",
    "### Your understanding:\n",
    "A hypothesis that no relationship exists between two sets of data or variables. If true, any observed effect is due to chance alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clarification (✔ Correct, but refined):\n",
    "- The null hypothesis **H₀** states there is **no effect**, **no difference**, or **no relationship** between variables.\n",
    "- It acts as the **default assumption** in a statistical test.\n",
    "- If **H₀** is true, any observed effect is assumed to be due to **random chance**.\n",

    "**Q2: What does the p-value signify?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your understanding:\n",
    "The p-value is the probability of the null hypothesis being true due to random chance.\n",
