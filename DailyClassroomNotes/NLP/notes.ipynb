    "## ðŸ”¹ Tokenization\n",
    "Breaking text into smaller units called *tokens* (words, sentences, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `word_tokenize()` â€“ Tokenizes text into words using NLTK.\n",
    "- `sent_tokenize()` â€“ Tokenizes text into sentences.\n",
    "- `blankline_tokenize` â€“ Splits text by blank lines.\n",
    "- `WhitespaceTokenizer().tokenize()` â€“ Splits text based only on spaces.\n",
    "- `wordpunct_tokenize` â€“ Splits text into words and punctuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¸ Types of Tokens\n",
    "- **Bigram** â€“ Sequence of 2 consecutive words  \n",
    "- **Trigram** â€“ Sequence of 3 consecutive words  \n",
    "- **N-gram** â€“ Sequence of *n* consecutive words\n",

    "## ðŸ”¹ Stemming\n",
    "Reduces words to their root form (not necessarily valid words).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `PorterStemmer()` â€“ Oldest stemmer, widely used, conservative.\n",
    "- `LancasterStemmer()` â€“ More aggressive, may over-stem.\n",
    "- `SnowballStemmer` â€“ Improved and more efficient stemming.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¹ Lemmatization\n",
    "Reduces words to their dictionary form (*lemma*). More accurate than stemming.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `WordNetLemmatizer` â€“ Uses WordNet lexical database for accurate root forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¹ Stop Words\n",
    "Common words (e.g., *the, is, and*) that are usually removed from analysis.\n",

    "## ðŸ”¹ Parts of Speech Tagging\n",
    "- `pos_tag()` â€“ Tags each word with its grammatical role (noun, verb, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¹ Named Entity Recognition (NER)\n",
    "- `ne_chunk()` â€“ Identifies named entities like people, organizations, and locations.\n",

    "- `TfidfVectorizer` â€“ Applies TF-IDF weighting to highlight important words.\n",
    "- **Word2Vec** â€“ Learns vector representations of words based on context.\n",
